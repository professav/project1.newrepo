Project Overview:
This project explored the impact of Education on Earnings along the Time with a focus on the Gap between Genders through data visualization. The conclusions were: 1) Both Earnings and Education level
increase continuously along the Time; 2) There is a consistent gap between Women's and men's earnings; 3) Education level does not narrow down or widen up this gap; 4) Effort is needed to bring
awareness to the gender pay gap.

**Team members:**
Elizabeth Arias, Sebastian Fajardo, Dawn Kim, Chearine P, Zhongzhe Shen (Dennis), Vanessa

**Dataset:**
US Bureau of Labor Statistics data set (https://www.bls.gov/data/#employment), spanning twenty years with salary, education, and gender as parameters.
Tools for Analysis:
Jupyter Notebook; Google Collab [https://colab.google/]

**Approach and Methodology:**
Started with project ideation, sourcing data & transforming it manually to the usable CSV file.  Then used Power BI to quickly assess the feasibility of the downloaded
downloaded dataset into an excel tab separated values. Further took Python to explore, clean and analyze the data. The new layout was stored as a standard
CSV file and Github for code repository. Finally built visualizations with Jupyter Notebook and Google Collab. Both top-down and bottom-up approachs were
adopted to come up with a narrative, synthesizing information/charts, and ensuring they answer the questions we set out to address.
