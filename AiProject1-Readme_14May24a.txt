Project Overview:
This project explored the impact of Education on Earnings along the Time through data visualization. The primary goal is to answer: 1) Do we earn more with
 education? 2) Does it vary by gender?
After data sourcing, processing and analysis using learned skills from the course, we concluded: 1) We earn more with education; 2) There is a consistent 
gap between Women's and men's earnings; 3) Education level does not narrow down or widen up this gap; 4) Effort is needed to bring awareness to the gender 
pay gap. 

????????????????? how do we know it is education (not time) brings the higher earnings ????????????????????????????????

Datasets Worked On: 
US Bureau of Labor Statistics data set (https://www.bls.gov/data/#employment),  with salary, education, and gender as parameters 
from 2000 to 2024.



Tools for Analysis: 
Jupyter Notebook; Google Collab [https://colab.google/]



Aprroach and Methodology: 
Started with project ideation, data sourcing & transforming (first downloaded manually to a usable CSV file, then used excel tab separated 
values and Power BI) to quickly assess the feasibility. Further applied Python to explore, clean, merge, compare, and correlate the data. 
(The new layout was stored as a CSV file and pushed Github for code repository.) Finally built visualizations with Jupyter Notebook and Google 
Collab. Both top-down and bottom-up approachs were adopted to come up with narrative, synthesizing information/charts, and ensure the questions 
we set out to address.
